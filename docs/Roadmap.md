# KeyLens Optimization Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision

KeyLens will evolve from a simple key counter into:

> A research-grade keyboard optimization platform.

The goal is to transform raw typing logs into ergonomic intelligence
and layout optimization insights.

---

# Phase 1 – Structural Analysis (Foundation)

## Goal
Enable deep structural analysis of typing behavior.

### Features
- [ ] Bigram / Trigram frequency analysis
- [ ] Same-finger repetition rate
- [ ] Hand alternation rate
- [ ] Application-specific profiling
- [ ] Time-window filtered transitions

### Outcome
Provides the statistical backbone required for ergonomic evaluation.

---

# Phase 2 – Ergonomic Intelligence

## Goal
Convert statistics into actionable ergonomic metrics.

### Features
- [ ] Ergonomic score calculation
- [ ] Finger load distribution analysis
- [ ] Thumb usage imbalance detection
- [ ] High-strain key sequence detection
- [ ] Weekly / Monthly behavioral reports

### Outcome
KeyLens becomes a behavioral analytics tool, not just a logger.

---

# Phase 3 – Layout Optimization Engine

## Goal
Recommend optimal key placements for split keyboards.

### Features
- [ ] Thumb key recommendation engine
- [ ] Key relocation simulation
- [ ] Before/After ergonomic score comparison
- [ ] ZMK config export
- [ ] Layout A/B testing

### Outcome
KeyLens becomes a keyboard design laboratory.

---

# Phase 4 – Research Platform Expansion

## Goal
Extend into AI-assisted ergonomic modeling.

### Features
- [ ] ML-based typing pattern classification
- [ ] Adaptive layout evolution simulation
- [ ] Predictive fatigue modeling
- [ ] Intelligent efficiency recommendations

### Outcome
Transition from analysis tool to adaptive optimization system.
